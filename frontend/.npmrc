# Use "hoisted" mode for node-linker to flatten node_modules
# - This makes pnpm behave more like npm/Yarn, reducing symlink complexity.
# - Fixes issues with Remix and Vite by ensuring proper dependency resolution.
# - Drastically reduces build size (e.g., from 1900KB to 43KB in this project).
# - Prevents duplicate dependencies from being bundled unnecessarily.
# - Improves compatibility with tools that struggle with pnpm's default symlinked structure.
